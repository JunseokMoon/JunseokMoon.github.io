Hello! I am a Ph.D. candidate in Chemical and Biological Engineering at Seoul National University, specializing in the intersection of artificial intelligence and materials science.

My research capability was demonstrated early in my doctoral journey, highlighted by a sole first-author publication in [<b><i>Nature Materials</i></b>](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41563-023-01707-w) achieved in my second year (submitted during the first).

By synergizing deep learning frameworks with hands-on synthesis and electrochemical characterization, I accelerate the discovery of next-generation solutions—ranging from clean-energy catalysts to bio-inspired materials.

I am deeply committed to translating abstract algorithms into real-world impact for sustainable energy and green hydrogen technologies, while advocating for explainable, human-centered AI.

My ultimate vision is to pioneer automated laboratories where AI, robotics, and scientists collaborate to engineer a sustainable future.
