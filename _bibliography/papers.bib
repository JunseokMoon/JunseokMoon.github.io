  title={Oxygen-plasma-treated Fe–N–C catalysts with dual binding sites for enhanced electrocatalytic polysulfide conversion in lithium–sulfur batteries},
  author={Jung†, Euiyeon and Kim†, Seong-Jun and Kim†, Jiheon and Koo, Sojung and Lee, Jaewoo and Kim, Shin-Yeong and Paidi, Vinod K. and Ko, Wonjae and <b><u>Moon</u></b>, <b><u>Junseok</u></b> and Lee, Kug-Seung and Cho, Sung-Pyo and Kim*, Duho and Yu*, Seung-Ho and Sung*, Yung-Eun and Hyeon*, Taeghwan},
  abstract={Enhanced polysulfide conversion kinetics is essential for realizing lithium–sulfur batteries with high energy density and rate performance and promising cyclability. The modification of the local atomic structure of MN<sub>x</sub> active sites in single-atom M–N–C catalysts was proposed to improve their electrocatalytic activity for demanding reactions by fine-tuning the interaction with reaction intermediates. Here, we demonstrate that engineering the binding geometry of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) by introducing dual binding sites improves the LiPS conversion kinetics. We use mild oxygen plasma treatment to introduce oxygen species into the Fe–N–C catalyst. The plasma-treated Fe–N–C (pFeNG) catalyst with dual sulfiphilic (mononuclear iron) and lithiophilic (oxygen) binding sites has a lower polysulfide decomposition energy, especially for Li<sub>2</sub>S redox, which is known to be the most sluggish process. The pFeNG cathode shows significant improvement, especially at high C rates (916.3 mA h g<sup>–1</sup> at 5C), with promising cycling performance.},

  title={Active learning guides discovery of a champion four-metal perovskite oxide for oxygen evolution electrocatalysis},
  author={<b><u>Moon†</u></b>, <b><u>Junseok</u></b> and Beker, Wiktor and Siek, Marta and Kim, Jiheon and Lee, Hyeon Seok and Hyeon*, Taeghwan and Grzybowski*, Bartosz A.},
  abstract={Multi-metal oxides in general and perovskite oxides in particular have attracted considerable attention as oxygen evolution electrocatalysts. Although numerous theoretical studies have been undertaken, the most promising perovskite-based catalysts continue to emerge from human-driven experimental campaigns rather than data-driven machine learning protocols, which are often limited by the scarcity of experimental data on which to train the models. This work promises to break this impasse by demonstrating that active learning on even small datasets—but supplemented by informative structural-characterization data and coupled with closed-loop experimentation—can yield materials of outstanding performance. The model we develop not only reproduces several non-obvious and actively studied experimental trends but also identifies a composition of a perovskite oxide electrocatalyst exhibiting an intrinsic overpotential at 10 mA cm<sup>–2</sup><sub>oxide</sub> of 391 mV, which is among the lowest known of four-metal perovskite oxides.},

  author={Wang†, Ke and Lee†, Wooseok and Zhang, Rui and Wang, Zijian and Zhang, Yu and <b><u>Moon</u></b>, <b><u>Junseok</u></b> and Shin, Dongho and Bootharaju, Megalamane S. and Du, Juan and Chen, Aibing and Back*, Seoin and Hyeon*, Taeghwan and Song*, Shuyan and Zhang, Hongjie and Wang*, Xiao},
  abstract={High-entropy oxides (HEOs) exhibit exceptional structural stability through configurational entropy maximization, yet their catalytic activity can be inadvertently constrained by the inherent activity–stability trade-off arising from dynamic site regeneration limitations. Here, we present an entropy recombination strategy that designs a spinel/rock salt core/shell mixed-phase HEO catalyst. This catalyst, featuring a spinel-core entropy modulator, achieves thermodynamic equilibrium via compositional entropy exchange, resulting in an ultra-active thin rock salt shell HEO. The catalyst demonstrates superior mass activity (318 μmol<sub>CO</sub> g<sub>cat</sub><sup>–1</sup> s<sup>–1</sup> at 380 °C) and stability in the reverse water gas shift reaction, surpassing Cu-based and even noble metal-based catalysts. The core/shell architecture facilitates a multicomponent surface, oxygen vacancy generation, and Cu exsolution, accelerating the redox pathway’s rate-determining step via enhanced hydrogen transport. This work represents a breakthrough in HEO structural engineering, with promising advancements in diverse catalytic applications.},

  title={Low‐Temperature Atomic Metal Deposition for an Efficient Dual‐Site Incorporated Photocatalyst},
  author={Yoo†, Seungwoo and Lee†, Chan Woo and Lee†, Kangjae and <b><u>Moon</u></b>, <b><u>Junseok</u></b> and Ji, Hyunsoo and Moon, Jaeho and Shin, Dongho and Kweon, Youngha and Lee, Juri and Kim, Kang and Lee, Jaewoo and Deng, Guocheng and Lee, Byoung-Hoon and Ryu, Jaeyune and Kim*, Minho and Bootharaju*, Megalamane S. and Hyeon*, Taeghwan},
  abstract={A universal, low-temperature atomic metal deposition (LTAMD) strategy is herein reported for synthesis of atomically dispersed metal catalysts (ADMCs) using metal carbonyl precursors. This scalable approach enables the fabrication of diverse ADMCs with various transition metals, including W, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Mo, Ru, Rh, and Re on oxide and carbon-based supports. Tungsten-incorporated TiO<sub>2</sub> exhibits exceptional photocatalytic benzene oxidation activity, attributed to the generation of surface oxygen vacancies with Ti<sup>3+</sup>, which act as active reduction sites under aerobic conditions, facilitating the formation of reduced oxygen intermediates. It is demonstrated that tungsten plays a crucial role in stabilizing these oxygen vacancies and promoting electron-hole separation by accommodating photogenerated holes and activating the C–H bond of benzene. Leveraging dual-site photocatalysis, the tungsten-TiO<sub>2</sub> system achieves a remarkable 42.7% yield in the photocatalytic oxidation of benzene to phenol, with high recyclability over ten cycles. By integrating theoretical insights with experimental results, a distinct photocatalytic mechanism is unveiled, driven by the synergistic interaction between atomic tungsten and TiO<sub>2</sub>. This strategy not only enables the energy-efficient synthesis of a broad range of ADMCs on various supports but also enhances the intrinsic catalytic properties of the TiO<sub>2</sub> photocatalyst without compromising its crystal or electronic structure.},

  title={Design Principles for Non-Iridium-Based Oxygen Evolution Catalysts in Proton Exchange Membrane Water Electrolyzers},
  author={Ahn†, Hyunsoo and Ji†, Hyunsoo and <b><u>Moon†</u></b>, <b><u>Junseok</u></b> and Bootharaju, Megalamane S. and Hyeon*, Taeghwan and Lee*, Byoung-Hoon},
  abstract={Proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) is a leading technology for green hydrogen production, known for its high current density, compact design, and excellent compatibility with variable renewable energy sources. However, the sluggish kinetics and harsh operating conditions of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode pose significant challenges, particularly for catalyst activity and durability. While iridium (Ir)-based catalysts remain the industry standard due to their stability in acidic environments, their scarcity and high cost limit large-scale deployment. This review focuses on the development of non-Ir OER catalysts capable of operating under industrially relevant current densities (>1 A cm<sup>–2</sup>) with long-term stability. We first examine ruthenium-based systems, which offer higher intrinsic activity than Ir but suffer from poor stability, and highlight recent strategies developed to enhance their durability. We then discuss earth-abundant, nonprecious metal catalysts (e.g., cobalt, manganese), emphasizing design principles that ensure both high activity and durability under realistic PEMWE conditions. Finally, we discuss emerging machine learning (ML)-driven approaches that accelerate catalyst discovery and optimization. By benchmarking recent progress against DOE targets, this review outlines the path forward for scalable, cost-effective green hydrogen production using non-Ir PEMWE catalysts.},
