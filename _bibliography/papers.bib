  abstract={Enhanced polysulfide conversion kinetics is essential for realizing lithium–sulfur batteries with high energy density and rate performance and promising cyclability. The modification of the local atomic structure of MN<sub>x</sub> active sites in single-atom M–N–C catalysts was proposed to improve their electrocatalytic activity for demanding reactions by fine-tuning the interaction with reaction intermediates. Here, we demonstrate that engineering the binding geometry of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) by introducing dual binding sites improves the LiPS conversion kinetics. We use mild oxygen plasma treatment to introduce oxygen species into the Fe–N–C catalyst. The plasma-treated Fe–N–C (pFeNG) catalyst with dual sulfiphilic (mononuclear iron) and lithiophilic (oxygen) binding sites has a lower polysulfide decomposition energy, especially for Li<sub>2</sub>S redox, which is known to be the most sluggish process. The pFeNG cathode shows significant improvement, especially at high C rates (916.3 mA h g<sup>–1</sup> at 5C), with promising cycling performance.},

  title={Active learning guides discovery of a champion four-metal perovskite oxide for oxygen evolution electrocatalysis},

  abstract={Multi-metal oxides in general and perovskite oxides in particular have attracted considerable attention as oxygen evolution electrocatalysts. Although numerous theoretical studies have been undertaken, the most promising perovskite-based catalysts continue to emerge from human-driven experimental campaigns rather than data-driven machine learning protocols, which are often limited by the scarcity of experimental data on which to train the models. This work promises to break this impasse by demonstrating that active learning on even small datasets—but supplemented by informative structural-characterization data and coupled with closed-loop experimentation—can yield materials of outstanding performance. The model we develop not only reproduces several non-obvious and actively studied experimental trends but also identifies a composition of a perovskite oxide electrocatalyst exhibiting an intrinsic overpotential at 10 mA cm<sup>–2</sup><sub>oxide</sub> of 391 mV, which is among the lowest known of four-metal perovskite oxides.},
